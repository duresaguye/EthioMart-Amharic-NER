10 Academy: Artificial Intelligence Mastery
Week 5 Challenge Document
Date: 15 Jan- 22 Jan 2025

Overview
Business Need
EthioMart has a vision to become the primary hub for all Telegram-based e-commerce activities in Ethiopia. With the increasing popularity of Telegram for business transactions, various independent e-commerce channels have emerged, each facilitating its own operations. However, this decentralization presents challenges for both vendors and customers who need to manage multiple channels for product discovery, order placement, and communication.
To solve this problem, EthioMart plans to create a single centralized platform that consolidates real-time data from multiple e-commerce Telegram channels into one unified channel. By doing this, they aim to provide a seamless experience for customers to explore and interact with multiple vendors in one place.
This project focuses on fine-tuning  LLM’s for Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that extracts key business entities such as product names, prices, and Locations, from text, images, and documents shared across these Telegram channels. The extracted data will be used to populate EthioMart's centralised database, making it a comprehensive e-commerce hub.
Key Objectives: 
Realtime data extraction from telegram channel 
Fine tuning LLM to extract  Entities like Product name, price location

Instructions
The task is divided into the following objectives
Amharic data collection and preprocessing 
Labeling amharic data for NER
Find Turning existing models for NER 
Model comparison with different NER models

Task 1: Data Ingestion and  Data Preprocessing
Set up a data ingestion system to fetch messages from multiple  Ethiopian-based Telegram e-commerce channels. Prepare the raw data (text, images) for entity extraction.
List of channels 
You have to select atleast 5 channels to fetch data and you can share each other since fine tuning needs more data
Steps:
Identify and connect to relevant Telegram channels using a custom scraper.
Implement a message ingestion system to collect text, images, and documents as they are posted in real time.
Preprocess text data by tokenizing, normalizing, and handling Amharic-specific linguistic features.
Clean and structure the data into a unified format, separating metadata (e.g., sender, timestamp) from message content.
Store preprocessed data in a structured format for further analysis.
Task 2 : Label a Subset of Dataset in CoNLL Format
You are tasked with labeling a portion of the provided dataset in the CoNLL format. This format is commonly used for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.
The goal is to identify and label entities such as products, price, and Location in Amharic text.
Use the above dataset  "Message" column of a larger dataset. Each message consists of text describing various products and entities.
CoNLL Format:
Each token (word) is labeled on its own line.
The token is followed by its entity label.
Blank lines separate individual sentences/messages.
Entity Types:
B-Product: The beginning of a product entity (e.g., "Baby bottle").
I-Product: Inside a product entity (e.g., the word "bottle" in "Baby bottle").
B-LOC: The beginning of a location entity (e.g., "Addis abeba", "Bole").
I-LOC: Inside a location entity (e.g., the word "Abeba" in “Addis abeba”)
B-PRICE: The beginning of a price entity (e.g., "ዋጋ 1000 ብር", "በ 100 ብር").
I -PRICE፡  Inside a price entity (e.g., the word "1000" in “ዋጋ 1000 ብር”)
O: Tokens that are outside any entities.
You need to label at least 30-50 messages from the provided dataset.
Save your work in a plain text file in the CoNLL format.
Task 3: Fine Tune NER Model 
Objective: Fine-tune a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract key entities (e.g., products, prices, and location) from Amharic Telegram messages.
Steps:
Use Google Colab or any other environment with GPU support for faster training.
Install necessary libraries by running the following commands:
You will use the pre-trained XLM-Roberta or bert-tiny-amharic or afroxmlr model, which supports multilingual tasks, including Amharic.
Load the labeled dataset in CoNLL format from the previous task.
You can use Hugging Face's datasets library to load the data or manually parse the CoNLL format into a pandas DataFrame.
Tokenize the data and align the labels with tokens produced by the tokenizer
Set up training arguments, such as learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, and evaluation strategy.
Use Hugging Face's Trainer API to fine-tune the model.
Evaluate the fine-tuned model on the validation set to check performance.
After fine-tuning, save the model for future use.
Task 4: Model Comparison & Selection
Compare different models and select the best-performing one for the entity extraction task.
Steps:
Finetune multiple models like XLM-Roberta: A large multilingual model for NER tasks, or DistilBERT: A smaller, lighter model for more efficient NER tasks, or mBERT (Multilingual BERT): A multilingual version of BERT, suitable for Amharic or .others?
Evaluate the fine-tuned model on the validation set to check performance.
Compare models based on accuracy, speed, and robustness in handling multi-modal data.
Select the best-performing model for production based on evaluation metrics.
Task 5: Model Interpretability
Use model interpretability tools to explain how the NER model identifies entities, ensuring transparency and trust in the system.
Steps:
Implement SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret the model’s predictions.
Analyze difficult cases where the model might struggle to identify entities correctly (e.g., ambiguous text, overlapping entities).
Generate reports on how the model makes decisions and identify areas for improvement.

└── LICENSE                      # License information

3. Automating the Setup:

Use the following Python script to create the directory structure in one go:

import os

# Define project structure
project_name = "EthioMart-NER-LLM"
structure = {
    "data": ["raw", "processed", "labeled"],
    "models": ["fine_tuned", "baseline"],
    "notebooks": [],
    "src": ["data_ingestion", "preprocessing", "labeling", "training", "evaluation", "interpretability", "utils"],
    "tests": [],
    "reports": [],
}

# Create directories
def create_project_structure(base_name, structure):
    os.makedirs(base_name, exist_ok=True)
    for folder, subfolders in structure.items():
        base_path = os.path.join(base_name, folder)
        os.makedirs(base_path, exist_ok=True)
        for subfolder in subfolders:
            os.makedirs(os.path.join(base_path, subfolder), exist_ok=True)

# Initialize project
create_project_structure(project_name, structure)

# Create placeholder files
placeholders = [
    "README.md", 
    "requirements.txt", 
    ".gitignore", 
    "LICENSE"
]
for file in placeholders:
    with open(os.path.join(project_name, file), 'w') as f:
        if file == "README.md":
            f.write(f"# {project_name}\n\nProject description and setup instructions.")
        elif file == "requirements.txt":
            f.write("# Add Python dependencies here.")
        elif file == ".gitignore":
            f.write("# Add files/folders to ignore here.")
        elif file == "LICENSE":
            f.write("MIT License")

print(f"Project structure for '{project_name}' created successfully!")

4. Running the Script:

    Copy the script into a Python file, e.g., setup_project.py.
    Run the script:

    python setup_project.py

    Your directory structure will be created with placeholder files.

This approach ensures your project is well-organized and ready for collaboration.
You said:
no just using mkdirs and touch
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

To create the project structure using mkdir and touch in a single command or script, follow these steps:
1. Command Line Script

You can use the following bash script to create the structure:

#!/bin/bash

# Project name
project_name="EthioMart-NER-LLM"

# Create directories
mkdir -p $project_name/{data/{raw,processed,labeled},models/{fine_tuned,baseline},notebooks,src/{data_ingestion,preprocessing,labeling,training,evaluation,interpretability,utils},tests,reports}

# Create placeholder files
touch $project_name/README.md
touch $project_name/requirements.txt
touch $project_name/.gitignore
touch $project_name/LICENSE
touch $project_name/reports/{interim_summary.pdf,final_report.pdf}
touch $project_name/tests/{test_data_preprocessing.py,test_training_pipeline.py,test_model_evaluation.py}
touch $project_name/notebooks/{data_preprocessing.ipynb,model_finetuning.ipynb,model_evaluation.ipynb,interpretability.ipynb}

echo "Project structure for '$project_name' created successfully!"

2. Steps to Execute:

    Copy the script into a file, e.g., setup_project.sh.
    Make the script executable:

chmod +x setup_project.sh

Run the script:

    ./setup_project.sh

Resulting Structure:

This will create the following:

If you want to use mkdir and touch commands directly in one go (without a script), you can do this:
Single Command:

mkdir -p EthioMart-NER-LLM/{data/{raw,processed,labeled},models/{fine_tuned,baseline},notebooks,src/{data_ingestion,preprocessing,labeling,training,evaluation,interpretability,utils},tests,reports} && \
touch EthioMart-NER-LLM/{README.md,requirements.txt,.gitignore,LICENSE} && \
touch EthioMart-NER-LLM/reports/{interim_summary.pdf,final

You said:
finsh it
ChatGPT said:

Here’s the full command to create the desired structure in one go using mkdir and touch:

mkdir -p EthioMart-NER-LLM/{data/{raw,processed,labeled},models/{fine_tuned,baseline},notebooks,src/{data_ingestion,preprocessing,labeling,training,evaluation,interpretability,utils},tests,reports} && \
touch EthioMart-NER-LLM/{README.md,requirements.txt,.gitignore,LICENSE} && \
touch EthioMart-NER-LLM/reports/{interim_summary.pdf,final_report.pdf} && \
touch EthioMart-NER-LLM/src/{data_ingestion/data_ingestion.py,preprocessing/preprocessing.py,labeling/labeling.py,training/training.py,evaluation/evaluation.py,interpretability/interpretability.py,utils/helpers.py} && \
touch EthioMart-NER-LLM/tests/{test_data_ingestion.py,test_preprocessing.py,test_labeling.py,test_training.py,test_evaluation.py}

Explanation:

    mkdir -p:
        Creates the entire folder structure, including nested directories.
        The -p flag ensures no errors if directories already exist.

    touch:
        Creates empty files in the specified paths.

    Subdirectories and Files:
        Creates the main directory (EthioMart-NER-LLM) with subdirectories like data, models, src, tests, and reports.
        Adds placeholder files like README.md, requirements.txt, and .gitignore.
        Populates scripts and test placeholders in src and tests.

You can copy-paste this command into a terminal, and the entire structure will be created in one go.
You said:
then what to do next 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

After creating the folder structure and placeholder files, you can proceed with the following steps to set up and start working on your project:
1. Initialize a Git Repository

cd EthioMart-NER-LLM
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project structure setup"

    This initializes a Git repository and commits your initial project structure.
    If you use GitHub or another remote repository, link it:

    git remote add origin <repository-url>
    git push -u origin main

2. Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

    Activates a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

3. Install Required Libraries

Add the required libraries to requirements.txt and install them:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Example requirements.txt (customize as needed):

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
transformers
torch
matplotlib

Then update your dependencies:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

4. Plan and Write Code

    Open your project in a code editor like VS Code or PyCharm.
    Implement the code in the appropriate files under src/.
        For example:
            src/data_ingestion/data_ingestion.py: Code for loading and ingesting raw data.
            src/preprocessing/preprocessing.py: Code for cleaning and transforming data.
            src/training/training.py: Code for model training.

5. Write Tests

    Add test cases to the tests/ directory using unittest or pytest.
    Example tests/test_training.py:

    import unittest
    from src.training.training import train_model

    class TestTraining(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_train_model(self):
            self.assertIsNotNone(train_model())  # Replace with actual test logic

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()

Run tests:

pytest tests/

6. Track Progress

    Use the README.md file to document:
        Project description.

The code you shared is scraping data from Telegram channels using the Telethon library, a Python wrapper for interacting with the Telegram API. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
Purpose

    It connects to the Telegram API using the provided credentials (api_id, api_hash, and phone).
    It extracts the most recent 100 messages from specified Telegram channels and saves the data as JSON files in a directory (data/raw/).

Key Components

    Setup the Telegram Client

client = TelegramClient('session_name', api_id, api_hash)

    This initializes the TelegramClient object with:
        session_name: Used to store the session information so you don't need to log in again.
        api_id and api_hash: Credentials from Telegram's Developer Console.
    It acts as the gateway to interact with Telegram's API.

Define the Target Channels

channel_names = ['channel1', 'channel2', 'channel3', 'channel4', 'channel5']

    A list of Telegram channels to scrape data from.
    Replace these with the actual channel usernames or IDs.

Fetch Channel Entity

channel = await client.get_entity(channel_name)

    Retrieves the channel's metadata (e.g., ID, title).

Scrape Messages

messages = await client.get_messages(channel, limit=100)

    Fetches up to 100 messages from the specified channel.

Process and Save Messages

data.append({
    'id': message.id,
    'date': message.date,
    'message': message.message,
    'sender_id': message.sender_id
})

    Extracts specific fields from each message:
        id: Unique ID of the message.
        date: Timestamp of the message.
        message: The content of the message (text).
        sender_id: The user ID of the sender.
    The messages are stored in a list, then written to a JSON file:

    with open(f'data/raw/{channel_name}.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)

Run the Client

    with client:
        client.loop.run_until_complete(main())

        Starts the Telegram client and executes the main() function to scrape data.

Outputs

    For each channel in channel_names, a JSON file is created in the data/raw/ directory.
    Each JSON file contains details of up to 100 messages from the respective channel, formatted like:

    [
        {
            "id": 12345,
            "date": "2025-01-01T12:00:00",
            "message": "Hello, this is a test message.",
            "sender_id": 67890
        },
        ...
    ]

What the Code is Doing

    Logging into Telegram using your credentials.
    Scraping recent messages from multiple Telegram channels.
    Saving the scraped data in a structured JSON format for further analysis or processing.

Potential Uses

    Analyzing channel content (e.g., trending topics, sentiment analysis).
    Backing up channel messages.
    Building a database for research or machine learning.

Things to Note

    Legal and Ethical Considerations:
        Scraping messages from Telegram channels may violate Telegram's terms of service or privacy guidelines.
        Ensure you have permission to scrape data from the specified channels.

    Error Handling:
        Add error handling for cases like:
            Invalid channel names.
            Permission errors (e.g., private channels).
            Network interruptions.

    Rate Limits:
        Telegram API enforces rate limits. Exceeding them may result in temporary bans.

    Directory Creation:
        Ensure the data/raw/ directory exists before running the script, or modify the code to create it:

        os.makedirs('data/raw', exist_ok=True)

Yes, to get the api_id and api_hash from Telegram, you must create a new application in Telegram's Developer Tools. Here's a guide on filling out the form, including whether the URL is required:
Field Details

    App Title
        Enter the name of your application.
        Example: TelegramScraper or DataCollector.

    Short Name
        Provide a short, alphanumeric identifier for your app (5-32 characters).
        Example: tgscraper or dataapp.

    URL
        Mandatory?
            Yes, it's required.
        What to provide?
            If your application doesn't have a website or isn't hosted online, you can provide any valid placeholder URL.
            Example: https://example.com or https://localhost.

    Platform
        Select the most relevant platform for your app.
        If you're using Python, choose Desktop or Other (and specify in the description).

If you're not receiving the verification code when running your Python script, there could be several reasons. Here's how you can troubleshoot the issue:
Why the Code Isn't Received?

    Public Channels
    Public channels do not affect receiving the code. Telegram uses the phone number you provided for account authentication.

    Incorrect Phone Number
        Ensure the number you entered is in the correct international format (+251 for Ethiopia, followed by your number without leading 0).

    Blocked or Restricted Account
        Check if your Telegram account is restricted or if you’ve been temporarily blocked due to suspicious activity.

    Too Many Attempts
        If you’ve tried multiple times, Telegram may temporarily block the authentication process. Wait for some time before trying again.

    Code Sent Elsewhere
        Ensure that the code isn’t being sent to another device logged into your Telegram account.
        Check the "Active Sessions" section in your Telegram app under Settings > Devices.

    Bot Token Instead of Phone
        If you’re using a bot token, it won’t work here. Bot tokens are only for bots, and bots can't join or read channel messages from public channels.

Steps to Resolve

    Verify the Phone Number
        Double-check the number and re-enter it in the correct format.

    Check Your Telegram App
        Open your Telegram app on any device where you’re logged in.
        Look for the verification code sent by Telegram (usually in a system chat).

    Re-Run the Script
        Close and re-run the script, ensuring you haven’t exhausted the allowed login attempts.

    Use the Right Credentials
        This script requires your personal Telegram account credentials (phone and verification code).
        Make sure you are not using bot credentials.

    Enable Two-Step Verification (if applicable)
        If you’ve enabled two-step verification, you’ll also need to provide your password.

Key Notes

    You don’t need to own the channels; public channels can be accessed if you have the correct permissions.
    The get_entity function should work for public channels if they are accessible through your account.

for public channels why it need my phone number and why 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

In order to use the Telethon library and interact with Telegram's API to access messages from public channels, your phone number is required for authentication. Here's why:
Why Your Phone Number is Needed

    Authentication & Authorization:
    Telegram API requires users to authenticate with their phone number as part of the process to interact with the platform through third-party applications like Telethon. Even though you're accessing public channels, the Telegram API needs to ensure the request is coming from a valid user, which is why it requests your phone number.

    Session Creation:
    When you use Telethon to connect to Telegram, it creates a session file. This session file stores information about your login state, such as your phone number, and is used to avoid re-authenticating on subsequent runs. The session file allows you to maintain an authenticated connection to Telegram without needing to re-enter your phone number each time.

    Access to Telegram Services:
    Telegram uses your phone number as an identifier for all interactions with its platform, even for public content. This is how the API distinguishes between different users and determines what data they can access (e.g., messages in public channels, user information, etc.).

    Rate Limiting & Security:
    By requiring a phone number for authentication, Telegram ensures that users are not spamming or abusing the API. Your phone number helps track requests, ensuring you aren’t making too many requests in a short period.

Public Channels and Phone Number Authentication

Even though you're trying to scrape public channels (which don't require you to join or be an admin), Telegram still requires authentication via phone number for API usage. This is because you need a valid Telegram account to make requests to the API, regardless of whether the channel is public or private.
How This Works with Public Channels

    No Need for Channel Ownership:
    You do not need to own or be a member of the public channels you're scraping. As long as the channels are public, you can access them using their usernames or links, provided you authenticate via your phone number.

    API Permissions:
    Once you're authenticated, you'll have the necessary permissions to access public channel data, including the messages and media. This is similar to how you can view public channel messages via the Telegram app after logging in with your phone number.

Alternatives to Using Your Phone Number

    Bots:
    If you want to interact with Telegram via an automated service without using your personal phone number, you can create a bot instead of using a user account. However, bots have more restricted access compared to regular user accounts, and cannot scrape messages from public channels in the same way a user can.

    Telegram API for Bots:
    If you're building a bot that needs to interact with public channels or groups, you can use Telegram's Bot API, but keep in mind that the functionality available to bots is limited compared to regular user accounts.

Summary

In short, your phone number is required because it's part of the process Telegram uses to identify and authenticate users interacting with its API. While you can scrape public channels without being a member, the authentication process is still necessary for API access.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

If you're not receiving the code when trying to authenticate your phone number with Telethon, here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:
1. Check if Your Phone Number is Correct

    Make sure you've entered your phone number correctly, including the country code. For Ethiopia, it should be +251 followed by your phone number.

2. Verify Internet Connection

    Ensure that your internet connection is stable and working properly. Sometimes, a poor or intermittent connection can delay or prevent the code from being sent.

3. Try Resending the Code

    When prompted to enter the code, there should be an option to resend the code. You can try this multiple times if you're not receiving the code.

4. Check Your SMS Inbox or Telegram App

    SMS: The code is usually sent via SMS, so check your regular SMS inbox for the code.
    Telegram App: Occasionally, Telegram might send the code via a Telegram message instead of an SMS. Open the Telegram app and check for any new messages from Telegram itself.

5. Check for Service Outages

    Telegram might be experiencing issues with its authentication service. Check Telegram's official support or Twitter page for any updates regarding outages.

6. Use a Different Method to Receive the Code

    If you still don't receive the code, you might be able to authenticate via Telegram's mobile app or Telegram Desktop if it's installed. Try logging into Telegram using these methods and see if the code arrives through one of those channels.

7. Clear Telethon Session (if applicable)

    If you’ve tried this before and your session is stuck, you can try clearing the session files and start fresh:
        Delete the session file (usually named something like session_name.session).
        Then, try again with client.start(phone).

8. Wait and Retry

    Sometimes, delays in receiving the authentication code can happen due to network or server issues. Waiting a few minutes and trying again could resolve the problem.

If the issue persists after trying these steps, you may want to consider contacting Telegram support directly or checking for any specific issues related to your phone number or country.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

If you are not receiving the code even after entering your phone number correctly, and you're seeing the prompt "Please enter the code you received," here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot:
1. Check Phone Number Format

Ensure the phone number is entered with the correct international dialing code. For Ethiopia, the correct format is:

    +251994445412 (without spaces or other special characters)

If there's an extra space or formatting issue, it could lead to the system not recognizing your phone number.
2. Wait for the Code

Sometimes, it might take a little longer than usual for the code to arrive. Ensure you’re giving it a few minutes.
3. Check SMS Inbox and Telegram App

    SMS: The code is usually sent via SMS. Check your regular SMS inbox for the authentication code.
    Telegram App: Occasionally, Telegram sends the code through its app instead of SMS. Open the Telegram app and look for a message from Telegram with the code.

4. Resend the Code

There should be an option to resend the code in the prompt you're seeing. Try resending the code and see if it works.
5. Check for Telegram Service Issues

Telegram might be experiencing temporary issues with sending authentication codes, so you can check Telegram's official channels or Twitter for any updates regarding this issue.
6. Log into Telegram to Receive the Code

    Open the Telegram app (on your phone or desktop).
    Try logging in with your phone number there, and see if you receive the code in Telegram itself (this is another method of verification).

7. Clear Session (if previously tried)

If you've tried this process before, you might need to delete the previous session files created by Telethon. This can be done by deleting the scraping_session.session file or any other session file generated.

After deleting the session, try again to start fresh:

rm scraping_session.session

8. Use a Bot Token (Alternative Method)

Instead of using your phone number for authentication, you can use a Telegram Bot Token to authenticate. This method avoids phone verification.

    Create a bot on Telegram by chatting with @BotFather and get the Bot Token.

    Use the token instead of the phone number when starting the client:

    Replace:

client = TelegramClient('scraping_session', api_id, api_hash)

with:

    client = TelegramClient('scraping_session', api_id, api_hash).start(bot_token='YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')

This approach should bypass the need for phone number verification entirely.
9. Check Your Country's SMS Delivery

Sometimes, SMS delivery might be delayed or restricted depending on your region or carrier. In such cases, using the bot token method or trying again after some time might help.
10. Try a Different Phone Number

If all else fails, you can try using a different phone number to verify, as there could be issues with the one you're currently using.

By following these steps, you should be able to either receive the code or proceed with an alternative method (bot token). Let me know if you're still facing issues!

Set up a data ingestion system to fetch messages from multiple  Ethiopian-based Telegram e-commerce channels. Prepare the raw data (text, images) for entity extraction.
List of channels 
You have to select atleast 5 channels to fetch data and you can share each other since fine tuning needs more data
Steps:
Identify and connect to relevant Telegram channels using a custom scraper.
Implement a message ingestion system to collect text, images, and documents as they are posted in real time.
Preprocess text data by tokenizing, normalizing, and handling Amharic-specific linguistic features.
Clean and structure the data into a unified format, separating metadata (e.g., sender, timestamp) from message content.
Store preprocessed data in a structured format for further analysis.
Task 2 : Label a Subset of Dataset in CoNLL Format
You are tasked with labeling a portion of the provided dataset in the CoNLL format. This format is commonly used for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.
The goal is to identify and label entities such as products, price, and Location in Amharic text.
Use the above dataset  "Message" column of a larger dataset. Each message consists of text describing various products and entities.
CoNLL Format:
Each token (word) is labeled on its own line.
The token is followed by its entity label.
Blank lines separate individual sentences/messages.
Entity Types:
B-Product: The beginning of a product entity (e.g., "Baby bottle").
I-Product: Inside a product entity (e.g., the word "bottle" in "Baby bottle").
B-LOC: The beginning of a location entity (e.g., "Addis abeba", "Bole").
I-LOC: Inside a location entity (e.g., the word "Abeba" in “Addis abeba”)
B-PRICE: The beginning of a price entity (e.g., "ዋጋ 1000 ብር", "በ 100 ብር").
I -PRICE፡  Inside a price entity (e.g., the word "1000" in “ዋጋ 1000 ብር”)

        Stores data (ID, date, message, sender ID) in JSON format in the data/raw directory.

    Suggestions:
        Add error handling for:
            Empty Messages: Skip messages with no text.
            Private Channels or Errors: Handle cases where channels are inaccessible or rate-limited.
            Network Issues: Retry on failure with exponential backoff.
        Include additional fields, like media or forwarded messages, if relevant:

        if message.media:
            media_path = f"media/{channel_name[1:]}_{message.id}.jpg"
            await message.download_media(media_path)
            data[-1]['media_path'] = media_path

Here's a detailed report based on your implementation and tasks. You can expand or format it as needed before submission.
Project Report: Data Ingestion and Preprocessing for Ethiopian Telegram E-commerce Channels
1. Introduction

This project involves building a data pipeline to collect and preprocess messages from Ethiopian-based Telegram e-commerce channels. The primary goal is to gather, clean, and structure data for further analysis, including entity extraction for Named Entity Recognition (NER). The project comprises two main tasks: data ingestion and data preprocessing, culminating in a labeled dataset in CoNLL format.
2. Task 1: Data Ingestion
Objective

To fetch messages from selected public Telegram e-commerce channels and store the raw data (text, metadata, and media) in a structured format.
Implementation Steps

    Environment Setup:
        Utilized the Telethon library to interact with the Telegram API.
        Loaded sensitive credentials (api_id, api_hash, phone) securely using the dotenv library.
        Set up directories for storing raw data (data/raw).

    Channel Selection:
        Identified five active Ethiopian e-commerce Telegram channels for data scraping:
            @modernshoppingcenter
            @Shewabrand
            @helloomarketethiopia
            @sinayelj
            @ZemenEskender

    Data Scraping:
        Implemented a custom scraper to:
            Connect to Telegram channels using the Telethon client.
            Fetch the most recent 100 messages from each channel.
            Extract relevant information, including:
                Message ID
                Timestamp
                Message content
                Sender ID
        Stored the extracted data in JSON files, with each channel's data saved separately in the data/raw directory.

    Error Handling:
        Included validation for missing or empty messages.
        Managed directory creation using os.makedirs() to avoid errors.

Challenges and Solutions:

    Challenge: Receiving authentication codes during Telethon login for public channels.
        Solution: Ensured proper API setup and active phone number registration with Telegram.

3. Task 2: Data Preprocessing
Objective

To preprocess the ingested raw data by cleaning and structuring it for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, with a focus on Amharic-specific linguistic features.
Implementation Steps

    Data Cleaning:
        Removed unnecessary whitespace using regex.
        Normalized text for consistency in tokenization.

    Data Structuring:
        Converted JSON files into CSV format for easier analysis and labeling.
        Created a standardized schema including fields like:
            Message ID
            Timestamp
            Sender ID
            Preprocessed message content

    Amharic Text Handling:
        Tokenized messages while considering unique linguistic structures in Amharic.
        Retained contextual information to ensure accuracy in later labeling tasks.

    Storage:
        Saved cleaned data in the data/processed directory.

Challenges and Solutions:

    Challenge: Handling mixed-language messages (Amharic and English).
        Solution: Applied regex patterns tailored to Amharic script.

4. Task 3: Dataset Labeling
Objective

To label a subset of the dataset in CoNLL format for NER tasks, focusing on identifying entities such as products, prices, and locations.
Implementation Steps

    Entity Identification:
        Defined entity types:
            B-Product, I-Product: For product names (e.g., "Baby bottle").
            B-PRICE, I-PRICE: For price information (e.g., "ዋጋ 100 ብር").
            B-LOC, I-LOC: For locations (e.g., "Addis Abeba").
            O: Tokens outside any entity.

    Annotation:
        Labeled tokens manually using the cleaned dataset from data/processed.
        Structured the labeled data in CoNLL format:

        Token    Entity
        ዋጋ      B-PRICE
        1000     I-PRICE
        ብር      I-PRICE

    Storage:
        Saved the labeled subset in a plain text file for future NER training.

5. Results

    Data Ingestion:
        Successfully ingested messages from five channels, saving 100 messages per channel in JSON format.
        Example output:

        {
            "id": 12345,
            "date": "2025-01-01T12:00:00",
            "message": "ዋጋ 1000 ብር በቦሌ ደርስ",
            "sender_id": 67890
        }

    Data Preprocessing:
        Processed messages were saved in structured CSV files with cleaned text.

    Labeling:
        Annotated a subset of 50 messages in CoNLL format, identifying entities like products, prices, and locations.

6. Conclusion and Future Work
Achievements:

    Built an end-to-end data pipeline for scraping, cleaning, and structuring Telegram e-commerce messages.
    Prepared labeled data for training NER models with a focus on Amharic linguistic features.
